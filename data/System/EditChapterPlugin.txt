This plugin implements a simple section editing feature comparable to
the one available for [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Section#Section_editing][MediaWiki]].
It adds link urls to headings so that users can edit the section below. Edit links are
enabeld only for those users that have edit access. Edit links are hidden unless you hover
with the mouse pointer over them and then displays an icon, defaulting to a pencil
<img src="%PUBURLPATH%/%WEB%/%TOPIC%/pencil.png" border="0" />.

Once installed, the plugin automatically enables sectional editing without any further
provisions. Note, that it will only detect headings created using TML (topic markup language), that is
writing =---++ heading= and the like. It is not sensitive to normal HTML-markup, so it
does not add an edit link to normal =&lt;h2>headings&lt;/h2>=.

Sections might be included into the current topic using [[VarINCLUDE][INCLUDE]]. The
edit link will be adjusted approriately, allowing to edit the correct target topic and
then redirect back to the current topic it has been included to.

---++ Configuration
There are a couple of preference variables to influence how and which headings are processed:
| *Name* | *Description* | *Default* |
| EDITCHAPTERPLUGIN_MINDEPTH | min depth of heading to edit the sections, 1=h1, 2=h2, 3=... | 1 | 
| EDITCHAPTERPLUGIN_MAXDEPTH | max depth of headings to edit | 6 | 
| EDITCHAPTERPLUGIN_EDITIMG \
| icon to be used in the edit link \
| =&lt;img src="%$nopPUBURLPATH%/%<nop>SYSTEMWEB%/EditChapterPlugin/uweb-g.gif" height="16" width="16" border="0" />= | 
| EDITCHAPTERPLUGIN_EDITLABELFORMAT \
| full format string to render the detected heading of a chapter \
| =&lt;span class="ecpHeading">$anchor&lt;/a>$heading&lt;a class="ecpEdit" href="$url" title="Edit this chapter">$img&lt;/a>&lt;/span>= |
| EDITCHAPTERPLUGIN_ENABLED \
| variable to enable/disable the EditChapterPlugin \
| on |


---++ Syntax

---+++ ENABLEEDITCHAPTER, DISABLEEDITCHAPTER
In addition to enable/disable the plugin using the =EDITCHAPTERPLUGIN_ENABLE=
preference variable, it can also be enabled disabled using the =%<nop>ENABLEEDITCHAPTER%= / =%<nop>DISABLEEDITCHAPTER%=
tags.

---+++ EXTRACTCHAPTER
Dedicated chapters of a topic can be extracted using the =%<nop>EXTRACTCHAPTER{}%= tag.
it takes the following parameters:

| *Name* | *Description* | *Default* |
| topic | target topic name to extract the chapter from | =%<nop>BASETOPIC%= |
| web | target web name | =%<nop>BASEWEB%= |
| nr | specify a single chapter to be extracted |  |
| from | specify first chapter to be extracted, use =to= to specify the last chapter | 0 |
| to | specify last chapter to be extracted, mostly used together with =from= | 9999999 |
| before | specify to extract all chapters before the given one | |
| after | specify to extract all chapters after the given one | |
| encode | enable/disable entity encoding, used when embeding into an HTML input element | on |

Example:
<verbatim>
<textarea style="display:none">
  %EXTRACTCHAPTER{before="1"}%
</textarea>
<textarea>
  %EXTRACTCHAPTER{nr="1" encode="on"}%
</textarea>
<textarea style="display:none">
  %EXTRACTCHAPTER{after="1}%
</textarea>
</verbatim>

See the =edit.chapter.tmpl= for a real-world example, used as a cover to the standard edit
templates, thus hooking in section editing into the standard editing process.

---+++ STARTCHAPTER/STOPCHAPTER
A chapter normally starts with a heading and ends at the next heading. To further reduce
the chunk that is made editable use the =%<nop>STARTCHAPTER%= and =%<nop>STOPCHAPTER%=
marks within a chapter. That way you might exclude markup that is physically located
between the two adjacent headings but should not be part of the edit session. 

Example:

<verbatim class="tml">
<table class="foswikiTable">
  <tr>
    <td>
---++ Cell 1
some text
%STOPCHAPTER%
   </td>
   <td>
---++ Cell 2
some other text
%STOPCHAPTER%
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>

---++ Warning
<div class="foswikiErrorMessage">
%STARTCHAPTER%
This is an error.
%STOPCHAPTER%
</div>
</verbatim>


---++ Limitations
For the purpose of simplicity a couple of shortcomings have to be accepted.

   1 parametrized includes: 
     the plugin does not know anything about parametrized includes, that is it won't work as
     expected if a topic includes text from a _named section_ of another topic using
     =%<nop>INCLUDE{"TargetTopic" section="onlythis"}%=. 
   1 wysiwyg editor:
     it currently does not work work together with Foswiki:Extensions/WysiwygPlugin
   1 explicit sectioning: 
     users can't specify any other section to be editable in isolation (e.g. using some
     =&lt;section> ... &lt;/section>= markup) other than by giving the respective section
     a heading.
